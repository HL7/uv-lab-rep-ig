			<p>This profile offers two options to indicate the Certified Reference Material used for the calibration (in general when the UCUM International Units are used for the results [IU]).</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The first to be used when the Certified Reference Material is represented by a coded concept</li>
					<li>The second when the Certified Reference Material is identified with an Identifier.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Adopters are invited to give their feedback about
				<ol>
					<li>The most proper way to refer the Certified Reference Material, that is by using an Identifier or a CodeableConcept</li>
					<li>If a CodeableReference should be used</li>
					<li>If this information should be an extension of the Observation resource, or of other elements (e.g. DeviceMetric.calibration)</li>
